                    You can't afford complicated code. Writing small and easily testable methods can 
                    certainly clean things up, but as your application grows your classes start to 
                    know too much. Large classes means a large cognitive overhead for understanding 
                    how things work, or why they don’t.
                    
                    It would be great to keep related things closer together. If this needs that to 
                    function, why aren't they right in front of your face? You might have broken 
                    things up well, but each time you search around for related code it begins to 
                    feel like a mess.
                    
                    The more time you need to understand your code and keep it well organized, the 
                    more expensive your project becomes.
                    
                    With organization like this, you have to keep more and more in your head as you 
                    dive deeper.
                    
                    Reviewing and understanding code takes time and the more time you spend the more 
                    money you burn. Business owners turn to you to churn out features that are valuable to their businesses.
                    
                    With every feature you add, your codebase is getting harder to manage.
                    
                    Perhaps you even argue about the merits of documenting your code. Sure, you may 
                    strive to make your code more readable but actually reading it doesn’t reveal 
                    how your application works as obviously as it should, and falling back to 
                    documentation isn’t going to change your code. That’s bad news when you’re doing 
                    maintenance work and even worse for newly hired developers.
                    
                    Finding yourself walking through code with a debugger means it's probably time to 
                    take a step back and rethink.
                    
                    Even hiring a new developer means everyone needs to slow down to get him or her 
                    oriented with the code.
                    
                    Object oriented programming is supposed to make this easier.
                    
                    While following the Model View Controller approach has made your code cleaner, 
                    and following conventions have reduced the need for documentation, there’s still plenty 
                    of room for improvement and too much time needed to instruct new developers. MVC was 
                    meant for reflecting the end user’s mental model but it still makes it too easy to hide 
                    the intentions of your program in your code.
                    
                    Sending developers to read docs, wikis and tests just to understand your system is a 
                    time-consuming and oft-ignored task. Ruby code should be readable!
                    
                    Wouldn’t it be so much better to open up a project and have it fit like a glove?
                    
                    If there was a way to write code that un-complicated the logic and put it in plain view, 
                    that would make things so much clearer. If you could write the business use cases in easy 
                    to read Ruby code, you’d be programming with a smile every day knowing all your effort is 
                    right where it needs to be.
                    
                    You can make this happen and Clean Ruby will teach you how.

                            I found this book kinda lacking, it's true that I don't have the latest 
                            version of it but still; the examples were a little bit vague. On another 
                            note the book have a lot of resources and start a discussion on how to 
                            create applications in general and with Rails in particular.

                            Beginning of the book is all right. However at some point author jumps 
                            from pure Ruby to Ruby on Rails, which is not exactly what I expected 
                            from the book. Maybe the title should be different? I think the book 
                            would benefit greately if the author stayed with just Ruby.
                        </p>
