                            Just switched jobs from a python shop to a Ruby on Rails shop & this book 
                            is helping me come up to speed on Ruby's syntactic sugar, of which there 
                            is arguably too much. Like, I don't want this much sugar; can you put in 
                            fewer pumps of the Torani flavor syrup, please? I like my iced coffee 
                            beverage on the bitter side, like my soul.

                            Anyway, back to the book. It's doing a fine job of rounding out my 
                            understanding of unfamiliar syntactical patterns as well as some of the 
                            more subtle gotchas like the difference between dup vs clone (hint: 
                            freeze!). You have to know to ask a question to find something on 
                            StackOverflow and I definitely don't know all the right questions to be 
                            asking.

                            I bought this book for a class I attended at a local, junior college. A 
                            good introductory book for Ruby. If you have no prior programming 
                            experience, a concept or two might be challenging to understand. I say 
                            that because the book does cover a lot of basic, programming concepts, 
                            but there are only a few exercises per chapter, which are mostly 
                            demonstrative and only scratches the surface. The exercises work, but I 
                            prefer a lot of examples so I can practice.
