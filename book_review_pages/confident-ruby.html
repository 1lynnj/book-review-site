                    For many programmers, discovering Ruby is a revelation. They are overjoyed by how 
                    elegantly and succinctly they can state problems in the language. But then the real 
                    world creeps in, and that joy gradually wanes as the code becomes cluttered with 
                    distracting edge case scenarios, error handling, and checks for nil.

                    Confident Ruby is a guide to recapturing the joy of writing Ruby by employing 
                    small patterns and stylistic choices to make each method tell a coherent story. 
                    Over the course of 32 patterns, you’ll learn how to isolate uncertainty at the 
                    borders of your code; how to avoid repetitive conditionals; and how to liberate 
                    your code from the chore of nil-checking. You’ll discover the four parts of a 
                    method, and how to use those parts to construct a narrative. Following along with 
                    real-world refactoring sessions, you’ll learn how to apply these lessons to legacy 
                    code.
                    
                    Whether you are a novice or an experienced Ruby hacker, this book will help you 
                    become a more confident and joyful programmer.

                            It's a good book. Is it short? Yes. Are all of these things in Avdi's blog 
                            already? Yes. But hey, it's also not that expensive. Plus having all of 
                            these ideas collected in a logical progression is nice for re-reading. 
                            The techniques in here are things you might think about when dealing with 
                            legacy codebases, but now this book exists to back up your ideas!

                            Avdi has been one of the most knowledgeable and skilled instructors in the 
                            Ruby community for years and this book was a pleasure to go through. I 
                            highly recommend it for developers interested in learning how to write 
                            elegant, confident Ruby code. I've been able to apply a number of the 
                            techniques directly into the applications that I work on.
