                    The reference for writing fantastic Rails applications

                    You build web applications, and you love Ruby on Rails because it provides a 
                    framework for developing applications that are are fast, fun, and easy to change. 
                    Over time these applications can become bloated, development slows down, and 
                    changes to the codebase become painful.
                    
                    This book was written to help you learn to detect emerging problems in your 
                    codebase; we'll deliver the solutions for fixing them, and maintaining an 
                    application that will be fun to work on for years to come.
                    
                    In addition to the book (in HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle formats), you also get a 
                    complete example application, and the ability to get your questions about Ruby 
                    on Rails answered by the thoughtbot team.
                    
                    The book is written using Markdown and pandoc and distributed via GitHub. When 
                    you purchase, we give you access directly to the repository, so you can use the 
                    GitHub comment and issue features to give us feedback about what we've written and what you'd like to see. Give us your toughest Ruby questions with GitHub issues, and we'll answer. Last but not least, also included is a Ruby on Rails reference application. What the book describes and explains, the example app demonstrates with real, working code. Fully up to date for Rails 3.2.
                    
                    This book is a work in progress.
                    The book isn't finished yet, but that's the point! By getting involved now, you 
                    get access to updates as we make them as well as the ability to influence the 
                    content of the book.

                            Great book, it covered lots of design patterns that can be used in any ruby 
                            application.

                            I liked it, it shows a lot of patterns to improve rails codebase ( some 
                            things can be useful for plain ruby, but it is centered in rails ). Some 
                            parts of the book are a bit difficult to follow and you can get lost, I 
                            miss a clearer structure.
